    <h1>My Journal as i go through NSS</h1>
    <p> May 21, So far, my day has been good. I have learned a lot more than I imagined for my first day. I cant 
        wait to continue my education, and learn as much as possible.

    <p> May 22, So today being my second day at NSS, I am feeling pretty good. Hopefully its a feeling that will stick, and 
        I dont end up in the gutter in a week or two. So i guess we will just see how it goes, and go with the flow.
        As each day passes, I am learning more and more. I cant wait until this 6 months is over so I can see how much
        I have learned.
